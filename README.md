- 👋 Hi, I’m @montgomerynorfleet As a software developer, I focus on creating unique projects that incorporate an understanding of behavioral marketing and gamification, improving the efficiency of everyday processes, and supporting environmental clean-up, mental health, hunger, and animal welfare efforts. Aside from working, I enjoy time with my rescue animals, outdoor adventures, supernatural films, vegan cooking, clearing litter, and spinning.  
- 👀 I’m interested in combining my education and years spent in various industries to develop great software and serve causes that matter. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and relational databases. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve full-stack skills, database connectivity, and creativity.
